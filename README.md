NCRC-client

This is a simple wrapper script that will be used to enable the use of a two-factor authentication mechanism for downloading NCRC controlled codes through the popular "Conda" distribution mechanism.

# NCRC Client

The NCRC client allows users to search, install, and upgrade Conda packages contained behind an RSA protected server. Technically, on the server-side, the packages produced for use by this tool must establish a certain prefix ('ncrc-' in this case). The end-user however need not worry about any prefix semantics. The NCRC client will handle whether or not users supply or not supply a prefix.

## Install NCRC

The NCRC client is available via INL's public Conda channel repository or from the Anaconda Idaholab channel. The client must be installed into the base environment.

INL Conda Repository:
```bash
$> conda activate base
$> conda config --add channels https://conda.software.inl.gov/public
$> conda install ncrc
```

Anaconda (will become deprecated):
```bash
$> conda activate base
$> conda config --add channels idaholab
$> conda install ncrc
```

You can also install NCRC from source:

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/idaholab/ncrc-client
$> cd ncrc-client
$> pip install .
```

## NCRC Syntax

```pre
usage: ncrc [-h] {install,remove,update,search,list} ...

Manage NCRC packages

positional arguments:
  {install,remove,update,search,list}
                        Available Commands.
    install             Install application
    remove              Prints information on how to remove application
    update              Update application
    search              Perform a regular expression search for an NCRC
                        application
    list                List all available NCRC applications

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

## NCRC Usage Examples

```bash
$> ncrc list
Loading channels: done
No match found for: ncrc-. Search: *ncrc-*
# Name                       Version           Build  Channel
ncrc-bison                2021_07_28         build_0  ncrc-applications
ncrc-bison                2021_08_08         build_0  ncrc-applications
ncrc-bison                2021_08_13         build_0  ncrc-applications
ncrc-griffin              2021_07_29         build_0  ncrc-applications
```
List all available NCRC applications

```bash
$> ncrc search griffin
Loading channels: done
# Name                       Version           Build  Channel
ncrc-griffin              2021_07_29         build_0  ncrc-applications
```
Lists all available versions of griffin

```bash
$> conda activate base
$> ncrc install bison
Username: johndoe
PIN+TOKEN: 
Installing bison=2021_08_08...


$> conda activate base
$> ncrc install bison=2021_07_28
Username: johndoe
PIN+TOKEN: 
Installing bison=2021_07_28...
```
Install the latest version of Bison (default Conda behavior), or a specific version thereof.

```bash
$> conda activate bison
$> ncrc update bison
```
Updates Bison (and everything else that may require an update).

```bash
$> ncrc remove bison
 Due to the way ncrc wraps itself into conda commands, it is best to
 remove the environment in which the application is installed. Begin
 by deactivating the application environment and then remove it:
	conda deactivate
	conda env remove -n bison
```
The NCRC script being a wrapper tool, is unable to perform such a function. The user must deactivate the environment and remove that environment using the appropraite conda commands.
